# ECG Signal Analysis
The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal shows the electrical activity of the heart in terms of quasi periodic voltage signals. The signal were studied and processed to analyze the activity of the heart. We measured the heart rate and flagged heart abnormalities or arrhythmia by ECG signal analysis.


The Project involved figuring out the most efficient pathway to execute these steps:-

1) Data collection and modification of data.  
2) Filtering the data and Noise using low and high pass filters.  
3) Finding Q,R,S peaks in the plot using MATLAB.  
4) Determining heart rate with the help of peaks.  
5) Classification of heartbeat sample into normal,abnormal,tachycardia, bradycardia based on heartbeat and QRS average value.
